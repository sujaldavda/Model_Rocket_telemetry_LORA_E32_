# Model_Rocket_telemetry_LORA_E32_
This repository contains two custom PCBs for a rocket telemetry system. Sonic is the transmitter board that collects data from the flight computers via IÂ²C and sends it using the LoRa E32-900T30D module. Echo is the receiver board that receives this data and passes it to the ground station for monitoring.
